=head1 NAME

forkprove - forking prove

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  forkprove -MMoose -MCatalyst -MDBIx::Class -j8 -lr t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

forkprove is a forking version of prove that allows you to preload
modules with C<-M> and then run each test after forking, potentially
makes most of the tests to run faster without an overhead of loading
the same modules again and again, while having an isolated, clean
testing environment with a fork.

It works well with parallel testing as well, combined with C<-j> option.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

You can specify an environment variable C<PERL_FORKPROVE_IGNORE> to
contain a regular expression to ignore files to test with forkprove.

  PERL_FORKPROVE_IGNORE=no-preload forkprove -lr t

This will run the tests with C</no-preload/> in its filenames and
directory and run with the standard perl execution via prove.

=head1 CAVEATS

Following kind of tests B<might> fail when tested under
forkprove. There are workarounds in forkprove to detect/fix some of
them, so don't be surprised if your tests still pass :)

Tests that rely on the value of C<$FindBin::Bin>.

Tests that relies on C<CHECK> and C<INIT> block to run correctly.

See also L<http://search.cpan.org/~flora/Test-Aggregate-0.364/lib/Test/Aggregate.pm#CAVEATS>,
many of which could apply to forkprove as well.

=head1 WHY

L<Test::Aggregate> allows you to create a nested TAP output by running
a whole bunch of C<.t> files from a directory.

forkprove shares the basic idea, but it creates a whole new test
environment by making a copy of the process with fork for each test,
which means it could run your tests that rely on the singleton state
etc. without modifying the code to run with Test::Aggregate.

=head1 TIPS

=over 4

=item *

If you have a bunch of modules you want to load, put them in a file
C<t/Bootstrap.pm> and load it:

  forkprove -Mt::Bootstrap

If you're lazy and just load all of C<.pm> files in lib and t: use
L<lib::require::all>

  forkprove -Mlib::require::all=lib,t

=back

=head1 PERFORMANCE

Your mileage might vary, if forkprove runs your tests faster or
not. For lightweight modules, we've found that using forkprove doesn't
make any siginificant difference, due to the fact that fork overhead
nullifies the benefit of preloading modules.

On the other hand, test suite with Moose, Catalyst and Dist::Zilla
seems to run 80-100% faster with forkprove and C<-jN> option.
